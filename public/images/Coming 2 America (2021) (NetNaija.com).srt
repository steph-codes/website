Today, we celebrate

17
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,777
30 years of Zamundan prosperity,

18
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,531
30 years of service
to our great nation

19
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,535
and 30 years
of delicious fast food.

00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,122
-We want to welcome you all to
McDowell's Zamunda. -(cheering)

21
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,044
The McDowell's menu is in no way

00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,505
influenced by
the McDonald's menu.

23
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,424
They've got Egg McMuffins.

24
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,301
We've got Egg McStuffins.

00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,969

We are also celebrating

26
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:02,391
the arrival of our new
Beyond Big Mick Burger!

27
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:06,312
And it's all part of my lovely
granddaughter's campaign

28
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,522
to reduce our, uh... our what?

29
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,149
Carbon footprint.

30
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,360
And without using
any animal by-products.

31
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,238
It's just
good old-fashioned grass.

32

Beautiful, leafy taste.

So delicious.

35
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,043
Maybe it would taste
much better with a...

36
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,795
(coughs) Pepsi.

37
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,799

You look tired, Father.

00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,623
Maybe he needs a nap.

44
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,045
I am the heir

00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,339

Behold! Prince Akeem
in his natural element,

52
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,826
cowering at the mercy
of the women in his life.

53
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,869
Semmi, perhaps you would like
to spar with my daughters

54
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,538
and teach them
some combinations.

55
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,999
(chuckles) No doubt, you are

56
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,500
their best teacher,
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,876
It is my daughters that teach me

58
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,211
in the languages
of the modern world.

59
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,921
For instance,

60
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,631
are my princely robes
not on fleek?

61
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,259
Oh, my God, Father.
To be on fleek is no more.

62
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,885
Really?

63
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,014
I rather enjoyed being on fleek.

64
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,557
SEMMI:
Your father has sent for you.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,892
He has an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

66
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,021
Tell me, Semmi,
this urgent matter--

67
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,648
does it concern
my marriage to a suitor

68
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,151
who shall one day sit
on the throne of Zamunda?

69
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,028
I will talk to Father alone.

70
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,452
And how is my father today?

71
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,079
He has already ordered
my execution three times.

72
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,415
Oh, then he must be
feeling better. (chuckles)

73

I did not come here for money.

110
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,128
I came here for blood.

111
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,299
But not the murder kind.

112
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,801
No, no, no, family blood.

113
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,220
Marriage blood, yes?

I advise you
to reconsider my offer.

134
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,618
It is better to be bound
by blood and marriage

135
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,997

00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,868

Yes, Father.

A male heir.

Once again, I apologize to you

157
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,011
for all of the shame
and disappointment

158
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,555
that my offspring's
genetic makeup has caused you.

159
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:01,768
My son, it appears
your shortcomings in masculinity

160
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,104
have turned out to be unfounded.

161

00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,150
in a vision.

163
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,528
You gots a son.

164
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,115
It is true.

165
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,702
You have a son, Akeem.

166
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,205
A bastard son.

167
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,291

you were looking
for the perfect woman?

00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,775
Yes.

176
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:53,153
Well, I too was--
how can I say this?

177
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,908
I was looking
for the perfect vagina.

178
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,953
Or any vagina.

179
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:07,084
We scoured the far reaches
of that loathsome city,

180
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,753
searching rather unsuccessfully
for the woman of your dreams.

the strength of our ancestors,
I shall know he is of my blood.

360
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,548
Then he must come back
to Zamunda

361
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,216
and take the princely test.

362
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,969
Heir to the throne of Zamunda,

363
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,138
born in America...

364
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,892
...land of opportunity.

365
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,188
What kind of man
do you think he is?

366
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,858
This bastard.

367
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,028
If he has Joffer blood
running through his veins,

368
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,197
I'm sure he's destined
for greatness.

369
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,829
-(phones ringing)
-(quiet chatter)

370
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,082
You think you look respectable?

371
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,792
I just want to look employable.

372
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,502
Ain't nobody gonna hire you
over all these

373
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,129
Mitt-Romney-looking-ass
shmiggas.

374
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,882
LAVELLE:
Why not? I got sales experience.

375
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,967
Which reminds me--
St. John's is at the Garden.

376
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,969
Now, I want you to take
these tickets up there.

377
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,971
Sell 'em at full freight
until tip-off.

378
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,766
I can't do this shit
no more, man. I really can't.

379
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,310
This hand-to-mouth shit,
it's got to stop, all right?

380
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,645
I got to get solid.

381
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,063
I'm in my 30s now.

382
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,689
Since when?

383
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,107
Today!

384
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,693
(quietly):
Today.

385
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,236
Today is my birthday.

386
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,863
And you forgot.

387
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,741
Listen to me, young Jedi, okay?

388
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,618
What you need to do
is learn to relax.

389
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,244
I'm your uncle.

390
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:47,455
You stay on the ground with me.
You dig it, son?

391
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,665
Uh, L. Junson.

392
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,376
Don't use white voice.

393
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,002
Present.

394
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,672
I do know smartphones.

395
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,507
I know technology, all right?

396
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,259
I'm well-versed
in emerging trends.

397
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,595
And I'll tell you this, too.

398
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,348
If you hire me,
I won't let you down.

399
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,308
That's really inspiring.

400
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,936
So, uh, just give me a chance,
Mr. Duke.

401
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,938
Oh, my God, please.
My father is Mr. Duke.

402
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,857
Uh, and my, uh, grandfather
and great-uncle,

403
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,193
who founded Duke & Duke.

404
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,237
-Uh, please just call me Calvin.
-All right.

405
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,488
I'm calling you Calvin.

406
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,282
I noticed here,
under education, that--

407
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,035
did it say that
you-you didn't graduate college?

408
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,704
Well, yeah, see,
I was three credits short

409
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,080
from getting my, uh,
business degree,

410
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,915
but then my mom got laid off,
and, uh,

411
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,626
you know, I had to, uh,
drop out to help with the rent.

412
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,129
-Is she addicted to drugs or...
-What?

413
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,506
-She have gambling issues or...
-No, man.

414
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,842
Pops, uh, in the picture or...

415
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,595
-My dad was not in the picture.
-Ah.

416
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,390
You know, I went
to boarding school,

417
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,058
so there were months
where I didn't see

418
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,228
my parents, except for breaks,
and, uh, it can be hard.

419
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,440
I mean, I've read
a lot of studies that say

420
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,900
that not having
a dominant male figure at home,

421
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,028
it's so detrimental to a child.

422
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,613
-Do they say that?
-Yeah, they say that.

423
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,490
-Who?
-Scientists.

424
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:06,951
-Bill Nye did a...
-The Science Guy.

425
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,536
Your guy, uh,
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

426
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,830
-(exhales sharply)
-Do you think that not having

427
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:15,418
that kind of male role model
could put you at a disadvantage?

428
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,629
No more of a disadvantage
than having a father

429
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,673
who handed you your position.

430
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,175
"Handed"?

431
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,719
I-I was not handed anything.

432
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,971
So you're saying
Daddy never donated a building

433
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,015
to get you into
an Ivy League school?

434
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,641
No. Yeah.

435
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,519
Well, there was
a small off-campus library.

436
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,064
And Daddy never
had to sneak you into

437
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,024
an overpriced rehab facility

438
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,109
to cover up
a cocaine addiction, Calvin?

439
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,403
It was oxy, and my mom took me.

440
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,322
(sighs)

441
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,782
Kiss my ass, Calvin.

442
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,200
Hey, you know something?

443
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,868
You've been judging me
since I walked in here.

444
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,537
Which sucks because
I am so motivated.

445
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,414
You know what, I-I just
can't wait for them to find

446
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,875
blackface photos of you
from the office party.

447
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,795
I was
Will Smith's Aladdin, okay?

448
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,296
Peace, Calvin.

449
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,298

CLARENCE: Floyd "Money"
Mayweather ain't shit!

463
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,421
He beat that Filipino boy ass.

464
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,298
"Pack-a-quando," "Pack-a-mondo."

465
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:47,593
Wh-Whatever his name is,
he beat that boy ass, Clarence.

466
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:51,180
And he beat that meshuggener
Conor McGregor, the Irishman.

467
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,558
Yeah, 'cause he had to do that
for the blacks.

468
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,560
In this political climate,
Black man can't be taking

469
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:56,978
no ass-whipping
from no white man.

470
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,104
Would've caused a riot.

471
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,397
I was ready to riot anyway.

472
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,149
I wanted to get me
one of them flat-screen TVs.

473
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,526
(laughter)

474
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,862
(entry bell jingles)

475
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,573
Well, I'll be damned!
Look who done come up in here.

476
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,701
Hey, it's Kunta Kinte and Ebola.

477
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,328
-Famine and Blood Diamond.
-Nelson Mandela and Winnie.

478
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,873
(Morris laughing)

479
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,499
Those hungry babies
with the flies on their face.

480
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,168
-Hey. Oh, oh, oh, oh.
-SAUL: Whoa, whoa.

481
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,711
CLARENCE: That's too much, man.
You stepped over the line, now.

482
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,212
We don't be talking that kind
of shit about the hungry babies.

483
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,256
You gonna have to get out my
chair talking that kind of shit.

484
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,674
Politically incorrect.

485
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,467
Somebody need to whip your ass.

486
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,511
Mm-hmm.
Get up and whip him, Sweets.

487
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,305
Hey, don't be putting the money
in my hand all rough.

488
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,806
Take your ass out of here.
You buy you a Flowbee

489
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,433
and cut your own damn hair
from now on.

490
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,977
Right now I could rip
a new ass in that kid.

491
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,103
It is so good to see you.

492
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,105
Your neighborhood
seems to be thriving.

493
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,273
Oh, that's that gentrification.

494
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,941
You know,
when the colored man here,

495
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,276
this neighborhood
didn't have shit.

496
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,986
When the white man move in,

497
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,447
they got their coffeehouses
and their dog parks,

498
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,159
and my brownstone on Foch
Boulevard is worth $10 million.

499
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,828
Your brownstone ain't worth
no ten million.

500
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,538
-My brownstone is, too, worth
$10 million! -(Morris laughs)

501
00:24:57,622 --> 00:25:00,166
And I'm gonna sell it
and get me a Tesla.

502
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,959
America has certainly changed
since our last visit.

503
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,880
Your Black president finally
united this great country.

504
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,590
Yeah, but it's all
gone to hell now.

505
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,218
We all gonna die.
Just don't know how.

506
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,802
SAUL:
It's gonna be the Nazis.

507
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,471
Nazis are back,

508
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,224
but now they dress
like the Best Buy Geek Squad

509
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,351
and they want to kill people.

510
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,896
Anybody could be a Nazi.
You ever notice that, Prince?

511
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,814
Akeem now is an African king.

512
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:25,066
CLARENCE:
Well, I'll be damned.

513
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,735
You got any kids? I got kids.

514
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,947
In fact, I got one granddaughter
used to be my grandson.

515
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,407
They can turn your penis
into a vagina now.

516
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,785
It's science.

517
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,328
MORRIS:
I bet they could fix

518
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,372
them long, sloppy titties
y'all got in Africa.

519
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,957
You can't even
squeeze a tit nowadays.

520
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,291
It'll get you fired.

521
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,418
I'm so sorry you can
no longer indiscriminately

522
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,545
touch a woman's body
at your every whim.

523
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,006
Oh, it's okay.
I got it in when I was young.

524
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,092
(laughter)

525
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,012
(wheezing laugh)

526
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,682
So what you doing back here,
Idiot Amin?

527
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,475
I am actually here
with a purpose.

528
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,019
I have just discovered
that I may have a bastard son

529
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,397
here in this land,

Oh! That's a damn lion, bruh!

1050
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:04,692
Only when you can retrieve
the whiskers from a resting lion

1051
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,527
will you be ready
to become prince.

1052
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:11,157
(laughing)

1053
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,450
This is a joke.

1054
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,243
(stammering):
This is a joke, 'cause I know

1055
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,120
your soft ass ain't never
do nothing like that.

1056
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,872
Oh, yes, I did.

1057
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,833
-On my very first attempt.
-Well...

1058
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,836
Yes. First attempt. Very brave.

1059
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,047
AKEEM: You will need the courage
of all your ancestors...

1060
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,174
A machete? A rocket launcher?
What you got?

1061
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,635
...and the cunningness
of your Western ways.

1062
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,096
And these.

1063
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,767
(lion growling)

1064
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,729
Thank you.

1065
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,862
(growling softly)

1066
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,282
Ain't this a bitch.

1067
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,702
(thunder crashes)

1068
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,203
LAVELLE:
I just don't belong here.

1069
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,831
You are the son
of the king of Zamunda.

1070
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,584
You come from a long line
of Joffers, and...

1071
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,671
I come from a long line
of broke-ass nobodies.

1072
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:11,300
What the hell I was thinking
that I could have this?

1073
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,386
Or any of it?

1074
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:17,014
Hey, for real, just...
cut this off, all right?

1075
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,725
Just cut it off.

1076
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:20,351
(Mirembe sighs)

1077
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:23,146
You want to get rid of
the royal princely braid?

1078
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:26,858
Well, this is fair.

1079
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:30,361
To be honest, it wasn't
a great look on you.

1080
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,782
Just one of the many
backward Zamundan traditions.

1081
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,077
Hell yeah.

1082
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:40,705
How long have you felt that way?
You know how itchy this is?

1083
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,749
-It's a rat tail.
-(laughs)

1084
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,293
(laughs) And what's up
with y'all and lion whiskers?

1085
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,128
Like, be for real--
what's up with that?

1086
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:48,838
(Mirembe laughing)

1087
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,674
Hey, yo, I-I can't do this
right now, man.

1088
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,471
Yo, look where I'm at.

1089
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,224
I'm not supposed to be here.

1090
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,102
You know, my whole life,
I had dreams

1091
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,021
that my pops
would show up and take

1092
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,231
me and my mom away
to a whole new life.

1093
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,233
And come to find out,
he's a king.

1094
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,027
To a whole damn country.

1095
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,154
And the only way
to meet his expectations

1096
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,866
is to walk with a stick
up my ass or get myself killed.

1097
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,953
This-this ain't my way, Mirembe.

1098
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:24,624
And I-I-I can't... I can't be
what he wants me to be.

1099
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:30,087
Then perhaps
be not as King Akeem

1100
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,423
but as Prince Akeem.

1101
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,927
Ain't that the same brother?

1102
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,846
You haven't heard the story.

1103
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,390
Everyone in Zamunda knows

1104
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:45,228
the legend of Prince Akeem

1105
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,815
-in the land of Queens.
-(thunder crashes)

1106
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,442
Prince Akeem was
a dutiful prince

1107
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,152
and loyal son of Zamunda.

1108
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:54,278
AKEEM:
Hello, Babar.

1109
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,863
MIREMBE:
But he believed that a man

1110
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,907
must walk his own path
and follow his heart.

1111
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,742
I intend to find my bride.

1112
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,577
What is wrong
with the one you have now?

1113
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:03,496
-Bark like a dog.
-(barking)

1114
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,164
AKEEM:
I want a woman that's going to

1115
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,041
arouse my intellect
as well as my loins.

1116
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,085
MIREMBE:
He flew across the sea

1117
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,586
to find his true love.

1118
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,838
Now there,

1119
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,924
in the barbaric land of Queens

1120
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,344
did Prince Akeem battle
bug-eyed burglars,

1121
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,221
foul-mouthed barbers

1122
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,099
and sexist men of the cloth

1123
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,476
to win the heart
of his true love,

1124
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,271

and beautiful and magical.

1130
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,454
A new dawn had arised
in Zamunda,

1131
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:46,873
a new sense of hope

1132
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:48,583

If it pleases Your Majesty,

1149
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,643
I present to you Kareem Junson,

1150
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,313
aka Uncle Reem,

1151
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,357
my royal consigliere.

1152
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,525
That's Italian
for "mack daddy mentor."

1153
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,779
You need no other teacher
than your king and your father.

1154
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,198
No, no, no, no. See, you watch
your bottom lip, money grip,

1155
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,824
'cause you understand,
while y'all was out here

00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,618
riding elephants
and chasing Tarzan,

1157
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,913
I was schooling this boy
on the streets of Queens.

1158
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,873
-All right, well, that's...
-No, 'cause he don't know me.

1159
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:13,250
-You do not know me.
-No, you don't know me.

1160
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:14,377
You do not know me.

1161
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,753
-You don't know me.
-I will cut you.

1162
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,004
Enough of this.

1163
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:23,469

you're welcome in my kingdom.

REEM: Benson, y'all got
some crab cakes, man?

1166
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,057
I need some protein.

-Benson is you.

1173
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:40,820
See his feet?

1174
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,113
-Yes.
-See where his hand at?

1175
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,864
-Mm-hmm.
-See how he moving?

1176
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,617
Yes. There's a fluidity to it.

1177
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:49,620
Yeah, it's like Bruce Lee said,
"Be like water."

1178

LAVELLE:
That's Hebbe Joffer.

1179
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:52,915
Legend has it
he could speak to animals,

1180
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,208
and people thought he was crazy

1181
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,002
until he made a giraffe

It appears a royal wedding

1183
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,965
may soon be upon us.

00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,842

we are joined by Semmi.

1185
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,260
Good to see you, Totatsi.

1186
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:07,763
According to our ZNN source
inside the palace,

1187
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,765
we are hearing-- and I quote--

1188
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:13,769
"The boy been balling
on this princely-ass test

1189
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:18,607
ever since his handsome
and mad smart uncle showed up."

1190
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,152
That is absurd, Totatsi.
Who is your source?

1191
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,112
What the deal? What the deal?

1192
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,239

-something that they regret...
-So, whenever a woman

1706
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:24,927
speaks her mind, including
our daughter, then you just...

1707

you mind your tongue!

You were supposed to bring this
kingdom to the 21st century,

1711
01:19:39,609 --> 01:19:43,946
but instead,
you push our daughter aside,

someone who has dedicated
her life to this country.

1713
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,621
And because she's a woman,

1714
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,915

1717
01:19:58,753 --> 01:20:00,421

1718
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:06,761

from my own bedroom?

It was simple,
and it made sense.

1733
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:25,923
Every day, I have moved
closer to the comfort of life,

1734
01:21:26,007 --> 01:21:28,050
and now my eyes are open,

Stop!

01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,733
Did you run here
all the way from Africa?

1914
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,152
Lavelle, you cannot do this.

Way down in the jungle deep,

2253
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:44,250
the lion stepped on
the signified monkey's feet.

2254
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:49,755

2255
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:53,301
You're standing on
my goddamn feet!"

01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:59,140
